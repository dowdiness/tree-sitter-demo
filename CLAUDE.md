# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Tree-sitter demo project focused on exploring Tree-sitter parsing capabilities. Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and incremental parsing library that can build and maintain syntax trees for source code.

## Dependencies

- `tree-sitter-cli`: Command-line interface for Tree-sitter
- `tree-sitter-javascript`: JavaScript grammar for Tree-sitter

## Common Commands

Currently no build, test, or lint scripts are configured. The project uses the default npm test script which exits with an error.

## Architecture

This is a minimal setup for experimenting with Tree-sitter parsing. The project structure suggests this is for learning or demonstrating Tree-sitter capabilities rather than a production application.
